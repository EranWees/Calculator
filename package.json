```*   `"predeploy": "npm run build"` will automatically run the build process before you deploy.
*   `"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"` will take the contents of the build output folder (`dist`) and push it to a branch named `gh-pages`.

#### **Step 4: Deploy the Application**

Now, all you need to do is run one command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run deploy
```This will build your project and then automatically push the necessary files to the `gh-pages` branch on your GitHub repository.

#### **Step 5: Configure GitHub Pages Source**

1.  Go to your repository on GitHub.
2.  Click on the **"Settings"** tab.
3.  In the left sidebar, click on **"Pages"**.
4.  Under "Build and deployment", for the **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**.
5.  Set the branch to **`gh-pages`** and the folder to **`/(root)`**.
6.  Click **"Save"**.

It might take a minute or two for the changes to go live. After that, your site at `https://eranwees.github.io/Calculator/` should load correctly.

If you still see a blank page after following these steps, press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` in your browser to open the Developer Console and check for any errors.
